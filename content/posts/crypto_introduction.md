Such a thing happened and I started a new job in the crypto domain knowing nothing about it.

Here are a few links which make me more aware of what's happening:

* [DEX](https://www.coinbase.com/en-gb/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-dex) - what is it and what are its advantages compared to centralized exchanges
* [The Open Network Architecture](https://blog.ton.org/the-architecture-behind-the-open-network) - an overview of the TON network architecture and ideas
* [How to build your own blockchain](https://bigishdata.com/2017/10/17/write-your-own-blockchain-part-1-creating-storing-syncing-displaying-mining-and-proving-work/) - a step-by-step guide for building a simple blockchain. Look into [my repo](https://github.com/sild/educhain) to see what happened!
